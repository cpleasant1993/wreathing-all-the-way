    <h1>Wreathing All The Way!</h1>
    <h2> This is a tutorial for beginners to make a mesh wreath.</h2>
    
    <p>Hello! My name is Chelsie. I am a fellow mesh wreath enthusiast, when I have the free time. When I started wreathing, I had no clue where to start. But, I knew that I was crafty enough to do it and I believe that anyone that has the time and patience, can learn how to wreath too. There are minimal materials that go into making a mesh wreath, the time is the tricky part of wreathing. I am sure that if you have talked to anyone about making wreaths, they say that a lot of materials are needed, but that is not true. As long as you have a local Dollar Tree, you can make a mesh wreath with items from the Dollar Tree. As there are many different types of wreaths, I will be explaining how to make a spiral mesh wreath along with a video of how to make a spiral mesh wreath.<p5>
    
      <p2>
      Let's get started with the materials that you will need to make your first bubble mesh wreath. You will need pipe cleaners, heavy duty scissors, hot glue and hot glue gun, a wreath wire frame, 15 packs of 10 inch by 5 foot deco mesh, and lastly any decorations that you want to add to the wreath after finishing the deco mesh.
      </p2>
    
      <p3>So, let's get to work on your first bubble mesh wreath! First thing that you will want to do is cut everything up. Depending on the size of the mesh that you purchase, you will have to cut the mesh. I would recommend getting the 10 inch by 5 foot mesh just so that you only have to cut pieces to use and not have to trim the mesh to fit on the wreath. Then, you will want to cut your pipe cleaners in half because using a full one will be too much on the back of the wreath, plus it will save on materials for you.
      </p3>
    
      <p4>Congratulations! You are ready to start working on your wreath! This part is the time consumer. The first thing to do is, cut the mesh into 20 inch sections and roll the sections into 3 rolls. Once you have the mesh sectioned out, you will want to take 3 pieces of the sectioned mesh and pinch them all together and wrap a pipe cleaner around the middle of the pipe mesh so that the mesh doesn't unfold. Once you have wrapped the pipe cleaner around the mesh and tightened as tight as you can get, you the put the mesh on the wreath frame. There are four rings on the wreath frame. You will want to tie to pipe cleaner to the two middle rings of the wreath frame. You will want to continue the same pattern until the wreath is full of spiral mesh. I like to bunch mine tightly so that it is fuller. It normally takes me about 15 rolls of mesh to complete a wreath.</p4>
    
      <p5>You are on the last portion of the wreath! Now that you have the wreath put together, you can add any type of little decor on the wreath using a hot glue gun. I will include photos of the wreaths that I have made just to give you an idea of what the wreath may look like.

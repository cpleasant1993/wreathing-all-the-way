    <h1>Wreathing All The Way!</h1>
    <h2> This is a tutorial for beginners to make a mesh wreath.</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Chelsie. I am a fellow mesh wreath enthusiast, when I have the free time. When I started wreathing, I had no clue where to start. But, I knew that I was crafty enough to do it and I believe that anyone that has the time and patience, can learn how to wreath too. There are minimal materials that go into making a mesh wreath, the time is the tricky part of wreathing. I am sure that if you have talked to anyone about making wreaths, they say that a lot of materials are needed, but that is not true. As long as you have a local Dollar Tree, you can make a mesh wreath with items from the Dollar Tree. As there are many different types of wreaths, I will be explaining how to make a spiral mesh wreath along with a video of how to make a spiral mesh wreath.<p>
